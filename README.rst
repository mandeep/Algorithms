Algorithms intends to be an encyclopedia of popular and classic algorithms written
in Python with a focus on readability. Professors and computer scientists around
the world refrain from using design patterns and insist on naming variables
with single letters. The aim of this library is to present algorithms in an
approachable fashion.
