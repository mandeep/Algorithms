Algorithms intends to be an encyclopedia of popular and classic algorithms written
in Python with a focus on readability. Classical algorithms are still written without
adherence to modern code quality and design patterns, which does not lend itself to
straightforward instruction to those new to the discipline. This library aims to present
algorithms in a clear and approachable fashion.
