Algorithms intends to be an encyclopedia of popular and classic algorithms written
in Python with a focus on readability. Professors and computer scientists around
the world write code with a complete disregard for code quality and design patterns,
which does not lend itself to straightforward instruction. This library aims to present
algorithms in an approachable and clear fashion.
